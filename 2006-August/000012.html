-== Welcome to Rails
+# $Id: $
 
-Rails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes everything
-needed to create database-backed web-applications according to the
-Model-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view (also
-called the presentation) into &quot;dumb&quot; templates that are primarily responsible
-for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the
-&quot;smart&quot; domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post) that holds all
-the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a database. The
-controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New Account, Update
-Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing data to the view.
+HUMAN.R a Rails pet-project
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
-In Rails, the model is handled by what's called an object-relational mapping
-layer entitled Active Record. This layer allows you to present the data from
-database rows as objects and embellish these data objects with business logic
-methods. You can read more about Active Record in 
-link:files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html.
+What:
 
-The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
-layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two layers
-are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence. This is
-unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack that is much
-more separate. Each of these packages can be used independently outside of
-Rails.  You can read more about Action Pack in 
-link:files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html.
+  Human Resources Rails Pet-Project
 
+Preq:
 
-== Getting started
+  Ruby (1.8.4)
+  Rails (1.1.4)
+  Database server supported by Rails
 
-1. Start the web server: &lt;tt&gt;ruby script/server&lt;/tt&gt; (run with --help for options)
-2. Go to <A HREF="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</A> and get &quot;Welcome aboard: You&#8217;re riding the Rails!&quot;
-3. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application
+Install:
 
+  $ cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
+edit config/database.yml to match your database connection settings.
+  $ rake migrate
+  $ script/server
 
-== Web servers
+Questions:
 
-Rails uses the built-in web server in Ruby called WEBrick by default, so you don't
-have to install or configure anything to play around. 
+  aurelian[at]locknet[dot]ro
 
-If you have lighttpd installed, though, it'll be used instead when running script/server.
-It's considerably faster than WEBrick and suited for production use, but requires additional
-installation and currently only works well on OS X/Unix (Windows users are encouraged
-to start with WEBrick). We recommend version 1.4.11 and higher. You can download it from
-<A HREF="http://www.lighttpd.net.">http://www.lighttpd.net.</A>
-
-If you want something that's halfway between WEBrick and lighttpd, we heartily recommend
-Mongrel. It's a Ruby-based web server with a C-component (so it requires compilation) that
-also works very well with Windows. See more at <A HREF="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/.">http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/.</A>
-
-But of course its also possible to run Rails with the premiere open source web server Apache.
-To get decent performance, though, you'll need to install FastCGI. For Apache 1.3, you want
-to use mod_fastcgi. For Apache 2.0+, you want to use mod_fcgid.
-
-See <A HREF="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI">http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/FastCGI</A> for more information on FastCGI.
-
-== Example for Apache conf
-
-  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
-    ServerName rails
-    DocumentRoot /path/application/public/
-    ErrorLog /path/application/log/server.log
-  
-    &lt;Directory /path/application/public/&gt;
-      Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
-      AllowOverride all
-      Allow from all
-      Order allow,deny
-    &lt;/Directory&gt;
-  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
-
-NOTE: Be sure that CGIs can be executed in that directory as well. So ExecCGI
-should be on and &quot;.cgi&quot; should respond. All requests from 127.0.0.1 go
-through CGI, so no Apache restart is necessary for changes. All other requests
-go through FCGI (or mod_ruby), which requires a restart to show changes.
-
-
-== Debugging Rails
-
-Have &quot;tail -f&quot; commands running on both the server.log, production.log, and
-test.log files. Rails will automatically display debugging and runtime
-information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown in the browser
-on requests from 127.0.0.1.
-
-
-== Breakpoints
-
-Breakpoint support is available through the script/breakpointer client. This
-means that you can break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate
-and change the model, AND then resume execution! Example:
-
-  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
-    def index
-      @posts = Post.find_all
-      breakpoint &quot;Breaking out from the list&quot;
-    end
-  end
-  
-So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present you
-with a IRB prompt in the breakpointer window. Here you can do things like:
-
-Executing breakpoint &quot;Breaking out from the list&quot; at .../webrick_server.rb:16 in 'breakpoint'
-
-  &gt;&gt; @posts.inspect
-  =&gt; &quot;[#&lt;Post:0x14a6be8 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;nil, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;1\&quot;}&gt;, 
-       #&lt;Post:0x14a6620 @attributes={\&quot;title\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Rails you know!\&quot;, \&quot;body\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;Only ten..\&quot;, \&quot;id\&quot;=&gt;\&quot;2\&quot;}&gt;]&quot;
-  &gt;&gt; @posts.first.title = &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;
-  =&gt; &quot;hello from a breakpoint&quot;
-
-...and even better is that you can examine how your runtime objects actually work:
-
-  &gt;&gt; f = @posts.first 
-  =&gt; #&lt;Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;}&gt;
-  &gt;&gt; f.
-  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)
-
-Finally, when you're ready to resume execution, you press CTRL-D
-
-
-== Console
-
-You can interact with the domain model by starting the console through script/console. 
-Here you'll have all parts of the application configured, just like it is when the
-application is running. You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the
-database. Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development environment.
-Passing an argument will specify a different environment, like &lt;tt&gt;script/console production&lt;/tt&gt;.
-
-
-== Description of contents
-
-app
-  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.
-
-app/controllers
-  Holds controllers that should be named like weblog_controller.rb for
-  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from
-  ActionController::Base.
-
-app/models
-  Holds models that should be named like post.rb.
-  Most models will descend from ActiveRecord::Base.
-  
-app/views
-  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
-  weblog/index.rhtml for the WeblogController#index action. All views use eRuby
-  syntax. This directory can also be used to keep stylesheets, images, and so on
-  that can be symlinked to public.
-  
-app/helpers
-  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblog_helper.rb.
-
-app/apis
-  Holds API classes for web services.
-
-config
-  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database, and other dependencies.
-
-components
-  Self-contained mini-applications that can bundle together controllers, models, and views.
-
-db
-  Contains the database schema in schema.rb.  db/migrate contains all
-  the sequence of Migrations for your schema.
-
-lib
-  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that doesn't
-  belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in the load path.
-    
-public
-  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for images, stylesheets,
-  and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the default HTML files.
-
-script
-  Helper scripts for automation and generation.
-
-test
-  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures.
-
-vendor
-  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins subdirectory.
-  This directory is in the load path.
